# Converting To WinUI3 Using C# Conversion Analyzers

## Background

The purpose of this project is to create a porting solution to allow Developers to convert WinUI2 projects to the new WinUI3 format. WinUI3 will be lifted out of Windows Operating System and ships as an independant NuGet package.

- WinUI is a native user experience (UX) framework for both Windows Desktop and UWP applications. WinUI ships as part of the Windows OS.
- WinUI3 is the next version of WinUI. It runs on the native Windows 10 UI platform and supports both Windows Desktop and UWP apps. WinUI3 ships as a NuGet package.

This porting assistance is provided in the form of Code Analyzers and Code Fixes. A Code Analyzer extends the Visual Studio experience and provides on the fly code inspections for C#. For most inspections these Code Analyzers provide light bulb quick fixes that can be applied to users code in the form of a Code Fix. A Code Fix consumes the diagnostics created by the Code Analyzer and modifies the C# file in-line. Users may choose to apply Code Fixes one at a time or resolve all instances of a Code Fix across a File, Project, or Solution.

## Description
This tool assists with the conversion process by providing Code Analyzers/Fixes to convert existing WinUI2 C# projects to WinUI3.

### What It Does:
Analyze/Convert C# files

- Updates Namespaces for Xaml Types from `Windows.UI.Xaml` to `Microsoft.UI.Xaml`
    - `Windows.UI.Xaml` is now `Microsoft.UI.Xaml`, so `using`s and explicit namespaces need to be updated
- Converts `App.OnLaunched` Method
    - Two updates need to be made to the `App.OnLaunched` method when converting to WinUI3:
    1. Target `Microsoft.UI.Xaml.LaunchactivatedEvenArgs` as the method parameter type
    2. Instances of the parameter name in the `App.OnLaunched` method body must invoke `UWPLaunchActivatedEventArgs`
- Highlights Deprecated Types
    - Some types such as `Windows.UI.Input.Inking`, and `Windows.UI.Xaml.Media.AcrylicBackgroundSource` are not supported in WinUI3. These may be identified by the analyzer as deprecated but cannot be converted automatically.

### What It Does Not Do

 - Modify .csproj files or modify/resolve conflicting NuGet packages
 - Remove deprecated Code
 - Analyze/Convert .xaml files

## Conversion Process
Necessary steps for converting a WinUI C# app to WinUI3: 

1. Install Microsoft.WinUI and WinUIConvert NuGet packages in your app using the NuGet package manager: see the [Install WinUI 3 Preview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/winui/winui3/#install-winui-3-preview-2) page for more information.

2. Uninstall Microsoft.UI.Xaml from your solution. Additional conflicting packages such as `Microsoft.Xaml.Behaviors.*` may also need to be removed.

3. Light Bulb suggestions should highlight issues that need to be updated for WinUI3 conversion.

4. Click the down arrow by the lightbulb, Convert to WinUI3 and select Fix all occurences in project.

5. All namespace changes should be fixed in your project!

6. The Analyzer can only parse C# code and not Xaml. WebView is now WebView2 and should be updated: see the [Getting Started](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/winui/winui3/) page for more information.

Note: some WInUI2 resources are not compatible with WinUI3. These issues may be highlighted in code but cannot be fixed by the converter.
